VOTABLE version 0.03
====================

The VOTABLE package is a set of Perl modules which provide an
object-oriented interface to VOTABLE-formatted XML files. The software
is built atop the Perl XML::DOM module (although that decision will be
revisited in a future release due to the high memory footprint of the
XML::DOM code).

The VOTABLE software provides a class for each valid element defined
in the VOTABLE DTD. The file VOTABLE.pm provides an overview of the
software, and detailed descriptions of each module are provided in the
POD header for each file.

The programs in the 'samples' subdireectory are older examples that do
not demonstrate some of the newer features of the software.

This software is considered to be in the 'advanced alpha' stage. All
questions and bug reports should be sent to:

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

Perl 5.6.1 or later, with complete standard module suite
XML::DOM 1.38 or later
XML::Parser 2.27 or later

All Perl items are available freely from CPAN
(http://www.cpan.org). There are other libraries required by these
items, but I do not yet have a definitive list. You may encounter
error messages when building the modules which indicate missing
subsidirary libraries. If you do, drop me a line and I will help you
track them down and install them.
